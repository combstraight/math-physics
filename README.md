# math-physics

This repository documents a personal journey through the fundamentals of mathematics and physics. It contains study notes, small experiments, and progress reports gathered while learning these subjects.

## Overview

The main goal is to develop a solid understanding of core topics in mathematics and physics. Material will be organized chronologically, covering areas such as calculus, linear algebra, classical mechanics, and basic electromagnetism. Notes will be supported with examples and problem sets.

Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude will be used to aid explanations and provide quick references.

## Getting Started

This repository currently contains only a few notes. Future updates will add more detailed guidelines and example problems. To follow along, clone the repository and browse the markdown files as they appear. See `guideline.md` (coming soon) for a tentative timeline of topics.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues with suggestions or pull requests that improve the explanations or add additional learning resources.
